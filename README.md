# DataScience-Heart_Disease_Prediction


Heart Disease Prediction
This project aims to build machine learning models using Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),
and Naive Bayes algorithms to predict  heart disease based on their medical attributes. The data set used here is from kaggle



Models
The project uses three different machine learning algorithms to predict heart disease:

Random Forest: Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make more accurate predictions.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): KNN is a classification algorithm that classifies new data points based on the similarity to their nearest neighbors in the training data.

Naive Bayes: Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier that assumes that the features of the data are independent of each other.
